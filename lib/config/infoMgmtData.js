    text : '<a href=”http://mfarm.co.ke/about”>M-Farm</a> is an agribusiness start-up located in Nairobi, Kenya that provides an app that works as a micro commodities exchange offering up prices on agricultural commodities. Farmers SMS a phone number and they receive up to date information on prices being paid for commodities they grow, input materials they use, and where to find buyers . The app helps farmers in Kenya earn a living so they may continue to run their farms and improve the overall Kenyan economy. Demand shifters provide useful insights into how M-Farm’s app helps Kenyan farmers find better prices for inputs and outputs of their business. According to <a href = “http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0073375969/information_center_view0/index.html”>Baye</a> demand shifters take into account variables that cause changes in demand other than the price of a good. M-Farm’s price listings illustrate the difference of demands between Nairobi and smaller villages in Kenya. In most of the commodity categories Nairobi offers the highest prices relative to the villages in Kenya. This could be due to a number of reasons including the lower relative income of people living outside of Nairobi and fewer people in a village. For these reasons the demand shifts from town to town in Kenya for reasons outside of pure quantity and price.',

Journalism hasn’t gone away and as long people like being informed it wont go anywhere. The consumers and businesses that make up the collective capitalist free market are redefining expectations of what journalism is. According to the <a href="http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Circulation-Volume/Newspaper-Circulation-Volume.aspx">Newspaper Association of America</a> the total number of daily newspapers in circulation has been in a steady decline since 1940, long before the widespread use of the Internet. There were a total of 1,878 daily newspapers in circulation in 1940 and as of 2011 there are a total of 1,382 daily newspapers in circulation. The rise of radio, TV, and then the Internet can be correlated to the decline of traditional journalism printed on paper but in this case correlation does not imply causation. According to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-19/newspapers-lose-10-dollars-in-print-for-every-digital-1.html”>Bloomberg</a>, newspapers loose $10 in print for every digital $1.

News organizations and individuals that have been able to chaptalize on these affordances have changed the nature of journalism, according to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/the-fading-newspaper/">Bloomberg</a>, into smaller interest based news organizations and blogs like the Drudge Report or TechCrunch.

    text : 'Offering infrequent sales over the course of the year is part of price discrimination; it’s a dance between consumers and sellers that determines the maximum price a consumer is willing to make a purchase at. Depending on the market, the price of the aforementioned product may be higher or lower. Planet Money used price haggling at a bazaar as an example of determining the price of a good between a customer and a seller. A seller may sell a product at a given price and the next customer may gain a more favorable or less favorable price for the same product from the same seller. Moreover, the hosts of Planet Money argued sales and coupons are a modern example of price discrimination. A customer that wants a deal may shop at the store when there is a sale or with coupons in hand. Another consumer that may not be so concerned with the price of the same good may shop at the store without a coupon or when a sale isn’t offered, hence price discrimination.<br />A personal example is my mother vs. JC Penny’s (Jacques Penné). Prior to 2011 my mother was an enormous JC Penny fan; she loved the sales. When JC Penny had a big sale she was there ready to go to get her 40% discount. In 2011 JC Penny hired a new CEO, Ron Johnson, who developed Apple’s retail strategy. <a href = “http://www.forbes.com/sites/lauraheller/2012/01/26/why-jcpenney-will-be-the-most-interesting-retailer-of-2012/”>In 2012 Johnson did away with JC Penny’s sales and coupons with deep discounts.</a> Instead Johnson revealed JC Penny’s new pricing strategy: <a href = “http://www.forbes.com/sites/retailwire/2012/01/24/switch-to-edlp-wheres-the-new-excitement-penney/2/”>every day low prices (EDLP).</a> Rather than sell a shirt for $40 and offer a discount of %50 on said shirt a handful of times during the year, Johnson decided it would be better to sell their products at low prices everyday and eliminate all sales. This proved to be disastrous for JC Penny. <a href = “http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2013/03/04/How-to-Ruin-a-Retail-Giant-in-One-Easy-Step#page1/”>Sales dropped 28.4% year over year and this was directly attributed to JC Penny’s new EDLP sales strategy.</a> The hosts of Planet Money argued that deals like coupons or sales have a shelf life, and after a while customers become complacent and begin to believe maybe they’re not getting a deal. Johnson realized this and reversed course, offering sales and coupons to customers, but it was too little to late, Johnson was fired latter on in the year. JC Penny rehired their former CEO, Mike Ullman who quickly reinstituted JC Penny’s former sales strategy. Mr. Ullman quickly <a href = “http://www.wwd.com/retail-news/financial/jc-penneys-ullman-touts-progress-7285483?src=nl/mornReport/20131121”>restored markups on products so consumer surplus could be achieved through sales and coupons.</a> JC Penny’s current results are mixed at the moment and analysts are skeptical if JC Penny can pull out its slump but it remains to be seen if reinstituting their old sales strategy (price discrimination) can save the business. My mother on the other hand has become a fan of JC Penny again and continues to shop there.',

    title : 'Elasticity of Programming Languages',
    subtitle : 'Price Elasticity',
    category : 'Economics for Information Managers',
    text : 'There’s a handful of determinants that factor into the elasticity of a good: availability of substitutes, the good’s breadth, percentage of income, the necessity of the good, the duration of a price change, brand loyalty, and who pays for goods. The availability of a substitute factors into elasticity depending on how liquid goods are between each other. Take for instance a back-end web developer that uses both Python and Java to create applications. In most cases the each language can be easily substituted for the other because they can be used to create the same things most of the time. Object-oriented languages, as a group, have a broad breadth and, as a group, have a lower elasticity because it’s harder to substitute an object-oriented language with a procedural language. If a developer is creating a server from scratch it may be harder to code the server in a procedural language like Cobol than an object-oriented language like Python. On the other hand, both Python and Java are general purpose object-oriented languages; however, Python is a weak type scripting language and is considered to be easier to code with but is considered to run slower; whereas, Java is a strong type language and is considered to be harder to construct programs with but is considered to run faster. In this case there are more substitutes for each language witch makes them more elastic. For instance I can substitute C++ for Java because both are strong typed object oriented languages. Likewise, Python can easily be substituted with Ruby or PHP because both are weak typed scripting languages.<br />Percentage of income also becomes a factor in choosing between languages. If a developer has little time to code a complex program then coding with Java becomes more elastic for the developer because the time to code in Java takes up a higher percentage of income (time) for coding making Java more elastic; on the other hand, Python may be more attractive to code the program with, because the amount of time it would take to use Python for coding takes up a smaller percentage of income making Python less elastic in this case. Necessity also comes into play when choosing a language to code with. If I’m using Python or Java to code a web service I still need to use HTML to present information in a browser, there is no substitute for HTML making it very inelastic.<br />Duration also factors into the language that is chosen to code in. Suppose the developer has been using both Java or Python to code back-end data mining programs because each has trade offs when coding data mining programs. As time passes each language builds on its strengths but suppose as time passes another language comes along that combines the best of both languages especially for data mining, such as the new language Julia. Time will tell if Julia begins to replace Python and Java for data mining development.<br />Brand loyalty also factors into the language a developer chooses to code in. If the developer works for an large financial institution that has a lot of proprietary, effective, and efficient legacy programs written in COBOL then any modifications to the legacy programs will probably need to be written in COBOL to maintain a lingua franca, making COBOL less elastic in this case. Finally who pays also factors into the elasticity of a computer language. If the developer isn’t very savvy then he might choose to only code in Python as opposed to Java because it’s less costly for his time to code in Python even though the cost to the user to operate the program may cost more time, so Python for this developer is inelastic.',

So, indifference curves are valuable because they help break down the problem of how consumers make choices between goods. A piece of software running on a server for a website can be used as an example. Suppose a successful company has a website with growing traffic that is taxing their webserver. The company has legacy code that was developed when the company was a start-up, and although they company was founded by highly talented programmers, the code was written in haste so the start-up could get to market quicker. Now that their company is growing the server the company has set up is having difficulty handling the growing traffic.<br />The company is growing but it still has a limited budget to fix their server woes, and they have two options: purchase faster hardware or purchase the services of more programmers. Between the two options the founders of the company are indifferent about either purchasing one or the other because either purchase could solve the company’s server problem; however, there are constraints and in this example it’s a financial budget. Programmers can optimize code that can process data faster but they are expensive, and new hardware can process information quicker and it’s cheaper than programmers but the solution is one-dimensional. If hardware is placed on the Y-axis of an indifference curve and programmers are placed on its X-axis then the slope of the budget line at the equilibrium point for the indifference curve will be much steeper because hardware is cheaper. If the budget is increased the slope will remain unchanged but the amounts of each good that can be purchased would increase. Suppose there is an enormous influx of good programming talent and the price for a programmer’s services decreases then the slope of the budget line will begin to flatten out because programmers are cheaper than hardware, hence the company can purchase more programming services than hardware.',

Moreover, 73% of apps in the Android market were free and 80% of those apps generated revenue through advertising. Apple generates revenue in the app market through charging developers for use of its platform.  In regards to the app market, Apple, Google, and Microsoft have the same business model as Levi Strauss during the <a href = “http://www.forbes.com/sites/tristanlouis/2013/08/10/how-much-do-average-apps-make/”>gold rush</a>: sell prospectors the tools they need to try and strike it rich; so, I don’t think their business model is all that different from older models. One of the differences between Levi’s and platform providers is that the platform providers charge a percentage for every app purchase and a fee to access the app market place. It would have been nice for Levi’s if they owned all of the rivers and mountains in California and then charged a yearly admission fee and demanded a percentage for all sales on gold mined in their rivers and mountains. Another iteration of the platform model could come from producers of 3D platforms. Some analysts are predicting a future where a typical household could own a 3D printer.

If a web design firm wins a fixed bid contract to create a web service for a company, the cost for creating the website is fixed for the customer. If scope creep increases the functionality of the web service, hence the output, it will have no effect on the price paid to the web design firm. The web design firm’s price was fixed in the contract.<br />Variable costs, according to Bayes, are such that an increase or decrease of outputs bears on the cost of creating said outputs: the costs change.  If scope creep increases the functionality of the web service being constructed by the web design firm then there are variable costs for the company. In order to create more functionality for the web service the firm will have to put in more hours to create the content and code to get the get the job done, hence the cost to the web design firm has increased due to an increase in output. <br />Sunk costs, according to Bayes, are such that they are forever lost once they have been paid.  When the web design firm won the fixed bid contract they did so with a proposal they submitted to the company. The time and resources put into the proposal are a sunk cost because the customer did not pay any of the design firms to submit a proposal. So, the firm put a lot of time and resources into the proposal with only the hope that they may win the contract. <br />Thinking about costs in such a way may force the web design firm to reconsider how they are compensated to create web services and the size of any fixed bid contract up for bidding.

Michael Tchao of Apple conceived of the device in 1991 and it was brought to market in 1993. By 1998 when Steve Jobs took back leadership of Apple he killed the product. In a Wired article Jobs is quoted: <br />“If Apple had been in a less precarious situation, I would have drilled down myself to figure out how to make it work. I didn’t trust the people running it. My gut was that there was some really good technology, but it was fucked up by mismanagement. By shutting it down, I freed up some good engineers who could work on new mobile devices. And eventually we got it right when we moved on to iPhones and the iPad.”<br />The popular media lambasted the Newton, including comedians and newspaper cartoonists for its poor handwriting recognition software.

And measures of productivity are also useful for gaining a better understanding of programmer productivity. Baye breaks measures of productivity into three metrics: total product, average product, and marginal product.  Total product is the maximum level of output that can be generated from a given amount of inputs. Average product measures the output generated per unit input. Marginal product measures the change in total output that is attributed to the last unit of an input.<br /><a href = “http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_coding_practices”>Tom Cargill</a> of Bell Labs coined the ninety-ninety rule that states the first 90% of code written accounts for the first 90% of development time, and the remaining 10% of code written accounts for the other 90% of development time. Part of the problem the last 10% of code is difficult to develop is due to <a href = “http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt”>technical debt</a>, that is poor decisions made early on in the development process have adverse systemic effects on code that is built upon those poor decisions. To remedy the productivity problem many studios have developed a set of inputs called best practices like code maintainability, dependability, and efficiency. In terms of measures of productivity quality functional code is the product and the marginal product will begin to decrease once a threshold for the amount of inputs is reached. Some studios that employ an agile software development approach will argue too many best practice guidelines inhibit the development process. A developer that is spending too much time managing best practices probably isn’t spending enough time on the problem at hand. Developing a set of standardized code will make revisions fluid but bogging a developer down with guidelines could have adverse effects of productivity.',

With market transactions, companies make things the right way. So in the case of paid labor a company only hires the most efficient amount of employees or inputs to complete the company’s work. On the downside if any of the employees quit then the company may have to train any new employees while also offering them a paycheck. In the case of the internship a company may be willing to hire an excess amount of labor or inputs because the interns are unpaid. If there is an excess of inputs then they may get in each other’s way. However, interns may be a source of future labor that the company doesn’t have to pay and train like they might have to with an untrained external candidate. In a competitive market, companies make the right things. In the case of paid labor, a tech company can choose between priorities, such as choosing between a developer with 7 years Java experience or two developers with 3 years experience each with Ruby on Rails. Furthermore, in the paid labor market a developer is forced to train in languages and technologies that an employer considers valuable and relevant, such as learning Ruby on Rails vs. Fortran. The downside to this is the never-ending training the developer has to go through throughout his career. This could cost money to take classes or buy training literature and it also costs time to train with new languages and technologies. With an un-paid intern, the company may no be as concerned about the kind of skills the candidate has because they may plan to train in-house. If there were only a non-paid intern system students wouldn’t necessarily have the market to give them incentive to study one language or another.',

In 1998 the US government and Microsoft’s competitors, such as Netscape accused the company of being an anticompetitive monopoly. In particular, the government attributed Netscape Navigator’s crushing defeat with Microsoft bundling Internet Explorer with the Windows operating system. In a perfectly competitive environment there’s many buyers and sellers, competitors offer identical products, there’s a perfect distribution of information throughout the market, no transaction costs, and there’s free entry and exit. There were many buyers of Intel based computers that came bundled with Microsoft software but there were not many competitors to Windows GUI based operating system. Alternatives to Windows were not identical but there were more similarities between Netscape Navigator and IE.  Moreover, there is transaction costs associated with purchasing Windows and by extension IE. The biggest barrier to Netscape was entry onto Windows computers. Competitors accused Microsoft of designing Windows to favor IE, so Netscape wasn’t optimized to run on Windows and suffered performance issues. Moreover, there wasn’t a perfect distribution of information. Microsoft withheld its Windows API from the market, so it was difficult for competitors like Netscape to write software optimized for Windows. Eventually the government and Microsoft compromised and part of the deal was that Microsoft makes available its API for Windows to anyone that wanted to develop software for it, even for a competitor. Now companies like Corel can write software, like Word Perfect, optimized for the Windows OS and that is in direct competition with Microsoft’s other software products like Word. This ruling has opened Microsoft to a monopolistically competitive environment. Many critics of Google, like Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer, according to Bort (2013), accuse the company of being a Monopoly, and Google’s use of sources of monopoly power may qualify Google as a monopoly. Baye (2013) describes sources of monopoly power, including economies of scale, which says costs of production for a product decrease when its scale of production is increased, and economies of scope, which says costs are reduced when more types of products are offered. Over the lifespan of Google, all of the data the company has amassed has given it a distinctive advantage. More data yields more precise data mining results for marketers. In the case of economies of scale, the more user data Google collects the cost of collecting the data is decreased, because the value of the data is scaled up. With more profit, Google has increased its economies of scope and decreased its costs. Google can collect data from a variety of different products and each with its own unique parameters.

The players in the market will have to work the problem out through pricing unless the FCC steps in with net neutrality laws. The tragedy of the commons can also effect information managers on a daily basis. Server time may be a common free resource shared by developers in a large tech company. If too many developers are accessing the limited server resources they could crash the server leaving all of the developers without server time. Google has worked this problem out in part through <a href = “http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/07/technology/07link.html?_r=0”>gamification</a>. Employees of Google have a lunchtime game where they bet on prediction markets with Goobles and at the end of each quarter they can convert Goobles to dollars or they can spend ““Goobles” on server time—often a scarce resource at Google” (<a href = “http://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2013/10/07/adam-penenberg-how-gamification-is-going-to-change-the-workplace/”>Shawbel</a>).',

    text : 'Rent seeking occurs, according to Baye, when one party increases their wealth through charging excessive rent without increasing productivity. This is typically done today through the manipulation of government policy and principally via lobbying. Baye points out “Lobbyists spend large sums of money in an attempt to affect these policies” (<a href = “http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0073375969/information_center_view0/index.html”>Baye</a>). An example is the recent defeat of net neutrality laws at the hands of Verizon Communications and under the FCC’s watch. Verizon took suit of the legal framework the FCC had used to govern open-internet regulations” (<a href = “http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-14/verizon-wins-net-neutrality-court-ruling-against-fcc.html”>Zajac & Shields</a>). According to Time magazine, “Since 1998, AT&T and Verizon have spent more than $340 million lobbying members of Congress, according to the Center for Responsive Politics” (<a href = “http://business.time.com/2014/01/15/net-neutrality-ruling-paves-the-way-for-internet-fast-lanes/”>Gustin</a>). ISPs can now rent seek through scarcity power and yet under the pretense of increased productivity. However, Netflix is accusing Verizon of charging excessive rents to have their media served unfettered. Forbes quoted the CEO of Netflix: “The big ISPs can make these demands – driving up costs and prices for everyone else – because of their market position” (<a href = “http://www.forbes.com/sites/amadoudiallo/2014/03/20/netflix-singles-out-comcast-in-call-for-stronger-net-neutrality/”>Diallo</a>). It’s early in the fight and it remains to be seen if any of the ISPs add productivity to create wealth.',

    subtitle : 'Rent Seeking',
    category : 'Economics for Information Managers',
    text : 'The annuity (subscription) revenue based business model championed by cloud and e-commerce companies can reduce risks of conducting business and associated costs with minimizing risk exposure. Baye gave six examples of how companies try to avoid risk, including “product quality, informative advertising, free samples, guarantees, chain stores, and insurance” (<a href = “http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0073375969/information_center_view0/index.html”>Baye</a>). With subscriptions, companies reduce risk associated with hoping for demand from their customer base. An article in Inc. identified four benefits of a subscription economy: “positive cash flow, higher profit margins, peace of mind, and better planning” (<a href = “http://www.inc.com/john-warrillow/whats-your-subscription-business-going-to-be.html”>Warrillow</a>). The main function of subscriptions is customers pay up front and then a fulfillment order is made resulting in positive cash flows. Subscriptions can afford higher profit margins because they eliminate the need for chain stores pointed out by Baye. Moreover, subscriptions also eliminate the need to waste informative advertising “to stimulate “one-off” buyers” (Warrillow). According to Inc., subscriptions reduce risk associated with calculating the amount of revenue available a following month and allows calculations “within three percent how much revenue [companies are] going to have next month” (Warrillow). Annuity revenue affords more consistency and less guesswork involved with what customers may or may not buy tomorrow.',

    title : 'The Possibility of Bubbles',
    subtitle : 'Fama vs Shiller',
    category : 'Economics for Information Managers',
    text : 'At the core of the disagreement between Fama and Shiller is how each economist views the markets: efficient or inefficient. Neither Fama nor Shiller believes the market is perfectly efficient or entirely inefficient but they do lean one-way or the other. Fama believes the markets are mostly efficient and Shiller believes the markets are mostly inefficient. For Fama, markets are efficient enough that most of the important information within a market is reflected within prices. Thus it’s presumptuous for any person to think he knows more about the market than the market itself and for that reason he is skeptical of the existence of bubbles. Bubbles are a presumptuous idea for Fama because it requires a person to they can predict what a market is going to do before the market has worked itself out. Until bubbles can be replicated through tests he will remain a skeptic.<br />On the other hand, Shiller believes markets are mostly inefficient. Shiller’s issue with Fama and many other economists is that they don’t take into consideration psychology or sociology. He believes people often behave irrationally, like ‘animal spirits’ in the markets and thus the markets are mostly inefficient. <a href = “http://www.bloomberg.com/video/shiller-says-easy-to-beat-the-market-long-term-gwJsH7FhSq2kuqASFetuWw.html”>Shiller</a> believes prices are also reflecting the irrational and a rational strategy can game an irrational market. I happen to agree with Schiller that bubbles do exist and they are indicative of irrational ‘animal spirits’. Shiller uses the housing bubble as an example in his book Animal Spirits to describe the price-to-earnings-to-price feedback anomaly. Shiller wrote, “the collateral ratio is the amount lenders lend to investors as a percentage of the value of the assets posted as collateral” (<a href = “http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8967.html”>Shiller & Akerlof</a>, 2010, p 136-135). If a house is leveraged and the value of the house as an asset goes up then the lenders will be willing to loan a larger percentage to the homeowner if they refinance. This in turn means lenders have more money working for them in these assets that represents annuity income. Earning more annuity income then positions the lenders to loan out even more money and make riskier bets such as such a sub-prime mortgages.<br /><a href = “http://www.bloomberg.com/video/professor-fama-explains-how-markets-really-work-xZ2ZCPrnR76PuEeN7543qA.html”>Cliff Asness</a>, founder of AQR capital and one of Fama’s former students, interviewed both Fama and Shiller on Bloomberg a couple of days ago and it was evident that both of these guys have more in common. In some ways it seems like they are comparing apples and oranges. Shiller believes crashes are the result of a bubble, born of emotion, which pop.  On the other hand Fama seems to think crashes are an efficient market predicting a recession.',
